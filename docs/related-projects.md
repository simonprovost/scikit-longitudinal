    -    _Open-source:_ ✅
    -    _Authors:_ [AmeliaES](https://github.com/AmeliaES), [EileenYXu](https://github.com/EileenYXu), [kwongsiufung](https://github.com/kwongsiufung)
    -    _GitHub Link:_ [TIDAL](https://github.com/TIDAL-modelling/TIDAL)
    -   _Description:_ Tool to Implement Developmental Analyses of Longitudinal data (TIDAL) is an R Shiny application that guides users through growth-curve modelling workflows for trajectories of symptoms and risk factors. It emphasises accessible visualisations and interpretation for clinicians, public health officials, and other stakeholders while keeping reproducible modelling logic front-and-centre.
    -   _Delivery formats:_ Hosted Shiny demo, R package, desktop app, and Docker image to support secure offline analyses alongside quick experimentation in the cloud.

        - **Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh:** Alex S. F. Kwong (Project Lead), Heather C. Whalley (Project Lead), Amelia Edmondson-Stait, Eileen Y. Xu, Liana Romaniuk, Iona Beange, Andrew M. McIntosh
        - **Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King’s College London:** Thalia C. Eley, Ellen J. Thompson (also University of Sussex)

!!! quote "Auto-prognosis"
    -    _Open-source:_ ✅
    -    _Authors:_ Fergus Imrie, Bogdan Cebere, Eoin F. McKinney, Mihaela van der Schaar
    -    _Github Link:_ [Auto-prognosis](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/autoprognosis)
    -   _Description:_ AutoPrognosis automatically searches and ensembles pipelines for classification, regression, and survival analysis with plugin-based components for preprocessing, modelling, calibration, and interpretation. Version 2.0 expands clinical-prognostic tooling with uncertainty quantification, imputation via HyperImpute, and Streamlit demonstrators while keeping Python and R entry points.
    - _Note:_ Auto-prognosis is highly correlated with the [StepWise Model Selection Via Deep Kernel Learning (SMS-DKL)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/zhang20f.html) and the [Clairvoyance](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/clairvoyance) projects. The original Auto-Prognosis documentation suggested longitudinal support via SMS-DKL, but longitudinal workflows do not appear to be available in the codebase today.

!!! quote "LongiTools"
    -    _Open-source:_ ⏳
    -    _Authors:_ Justiina Ronkainen et al. on behalf of the LongITools Project Group
    -    _Official Website:_ [LongiTools](https://longitools.org/)
    -   _Description:_ LongITools is a European research consortium investigating how environmental exposures, lifestyle, and biology interact across the life course to shape cardiometabolic disease risk. The project curates a longitudinal datasets catalogue (via [Molgenis Catalogue](https://molgeniscatalogue.org)) and an exposome toolbox to make cohort harmonisation, risk-factor tracking, and early-life intervention research more reproducible.
